            <p class="text-white">All human beings are born equal, but our gifts, callings, divine elections and predestinations vary. Born a twin to the staunch Roman Catholic family of Mr and Mrs Vincent Obi of Ubulu-Ihejifor in Oru-West L.G.A Imo State, Nigeria. Evangelist Chukwuebuka Anozie Obi is a powerful man of God who with grace, commitment and passion serves as the founder and spiritual director of Zion Prayer Movement Outreach (ZPMO), located in Ago-okota, Lagos, Nigeria.

            He is a strong reflection of Luke 4:18, whose life is dedicated to living by example and encouraging men and women to live up to their full potentials in Christ. At the tender age of 8, young Chukwuebuka’s spiritual gifts began to manifest. He would give prophecies to people known and unknown to him and it would come to pass just as he had prophesied. This caused many from different places to troop into his father’s compound in search of this gifted lad. After his education, he went off to Lagos for greener pastures which he hoped would be more favorable and beneficial to him as a young man. But this didn’t extinguish the fire of the Holy Spirit burning in him as the fire was unquenchable and so, it kept on burning. Although he got fully established in a thriving cable business, he was still unsatisfied and unfulfilled. He kept on living his normal life until one momentous morning, he heard a strong voice echoing into his ears that he had the anointing of the Holy Spirit running down his head (with the bible verse Isaiah 61:1) instructing him to shut down his business and go into full time evangelism. Complying with this instruction was quite arduous and backbreaking as his family was antagonistic. Alas, it came to pass and ZPMO was born. From inception till date, thousands of people from far and wide pour in to worship and different miracles and testimonies are recorded on a daily basis. Denominational discrimination has no bearing on his mandate or anointing. He cherishes his call in bringing forth the uncompromising word of God and the gift upon his life has blessed so many immeasurably.</p>
