            <h1 class="font-weight-bold" style="color: #B01B15;">What We Do?</h1>
            <p>Zion Prayer Movement Outreach (ZPMO), a non-denominational prayer ministry, located at Ago-Okota, Lagos, Nigeria, was founded by Holy Spirit through his Servant Evang. Chukwuebuka Anozie Obi. The ministry came into existence in 2009 after Evang. Chukwuebuka had an encounter with divinity. The Holy Spirit had told him he was anointed to bring the good news to the poor, heal the broken hearted, release the captives and set prisoners free. This was with evidence in the scriptural verses of Isaiah 61:1-3 and Luke 4:18-19. He was charged to forgo his successful business in order to fulfill this divine mandate.  <br><br>

            He heeded, although this didnâ€™t come without challenges and tribulations. He eventually gave up all his resources for his evangelical work. The name ZPMO was given by the Holy Spirit to the group of persons who associated with Evang. Chukwuebuka. This group, a handful of persons (about 11 of them) went to desert with him for prayers and God always made name for himself by the kind of miracles people testified to. Soon, the news spread vigorously and this caused a significant spike in number. The ministry had continued in desert without interruption from 2009 through 2012. At the time, Uruagu hall at Orile-Iganmu, Lagos, was rented for vigils and consultations. As 2012 rolled on, there was need to move to a bigger venue which would be capable of holding the large crowd that came to worship. God used well-meaning individuals to acquire a land, which is today, the permanent site of ZPMO. Multitudes from far and wide (within and outside Nigeria) converge on days of worship (Sunday fellowship, Wednesday prophetic adoration and Friday vigil) as scores of Christians from different denominations and even non-Christians join the Movement on regular basis. The anointing of the Holy Spirit working in ZPMO cannot be over emphasized. This is evident by the number and kinds of miracles continually recorded. These include the blind seeing, the lame walking, the deaf hearing, the spiritually possessed and oppressed set free, divine healing of different kinds of disease, to mention but a few. ZPMO holds dear, the strong believe that all power belongs to God and that with him, all things are possible. They believe also that the orchestrations and manipulations of the devil and his cohorts are not meant to be, thus the strict adherence to the divine mandate of redeeming the spiritual rights of believers.</p>
